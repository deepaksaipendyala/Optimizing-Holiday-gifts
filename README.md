Exercise: Optimizing - Holiday Gifts
In the last repo Optimizing-_Common_books_code, you learned that using vectorized operations and more efficient data structures can optimize your code. Let's use these tips for one more exercise.

Your online gift store has one million users that each listed a gift on a wishlist. You have the prices for each of these gifts stored in gift_costs.txt. For the holidays, you're going to give each customer their wishlist gift for free if the cost is under $25. Now, you want to calculate the total cost of all gifts under $25 to see how much you'd spend on free gifts.

Download the notebook file optimizing_code_holiday_gifts.ipynb and the gift_costs.txt file. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.
